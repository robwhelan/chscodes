Designed to be easy, portable, flexible, and maintainable, PHP stands at the cutting edge of web 
technologies. From Facebook to Wikipedia to the ever popular WordPress blog, all of these are written 
in PHP. Come learn what all the hype is about and what PHP can hold in store for you.</p></div></div><div class="row"><h2>About the Instructor</h2><div class="span3"><img src="http://www.blueacorn.com/wp-content/themes/blueacorn/images/staff/brys_sepulveda.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" /></div><div class="span6">Brys Sepulveda came out of the womb with a laptop in hand. Arguably from the last generation 
that existed in a time before the Internet, Brys started his fascination with computers as a 
toddler playing with his older brother's gaming consoles. The magic and wonder instilled in 
him from those devices still drives him today to pursue the amazing world of computers. With 
a passion for software engineering unparalleled in the industry, Brys has always striven to 
write elegant, efficient, and maintainable code. He strongly holds the belief that programming 
is an artisan craft much like clock making or carpentry. It's an art form that takes nothing 
but yourself and logic and creates something functional and beautiful. Having graduated from 
CofC with a BS in Computer Science in 2011, Brys is fresh off the boat in the work force. But, 
in just one year at Blue Acorn hes gone from being an Intern to a Systems Architect and heading 
a team of 6 as a technical lead. Brys teaches everyday as he lives and breathes PHP. As a technical 
lead, he is often in demand for solving problems and providing solutions. He has taught numerous 
internal classes at Blue Acorn both in the basics of PHP and advanced Object Oriented Design concepts.</div></div><div class="row"><h2>Required Resources</h2><div class="span3"><h3>Skillsets</h3><ul><li>Problem Solving Skills</li><li>Basic Programming</li><li>Basic OOD</li><li>HTML</li></ul></div><div class="span6">In order to excel in this course, previous exposure to any programming language is highly recommended. 
As an introduction to PHP, this course's main focus is to get you acclimated to the gotchas of PHP and 
the power that PHP gives you. With such a huge standard library, PHP comes so fully loaded that we could 
never cover everything so the topics will be as expansive as possible. Bring a willingness to learn and 
a good attitude. Nothing is more required for this course than the want and drive to learn and improve. 
More advanced topics will be covered in PHP 102.</div></div><div class="row"><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="span3"><img src="http://placehold.it/200&text=faq_pic" style="margin: 20px;" /></div><div class="span6"><ul><li><h3>Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?</h3><p>Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a statement of accomplishment signed by the instructor.</p></li><li><h3>What is the format of the class?</h3><p>The class consists of four lectures, which are usually around 60 minutes.
