  intro: 'In this class, you will learn how to use jQuery from beginning to end.'
  description: '''
    jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig. Used by over 52% of the 10,000 most visited websites, jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today. The use of the name jQuery is somewhat misleading, as the library has little to do with queries. Shortly after its release in January 2006, author John Resig stated, "I was, originally, going to use JSelect, but all the domain names were taken already."

    In this course, we will create multiple mini-applications in the browser illustrating the use and power of jQuery in modern web development. While there are numerous other javascript libraries and frameworks available (such as Prototype, MooTools, etc.) that offer similar features, jQuery is by far the most popular and most commonly encountered. Additionally, if you know jQuery well, you can easily and fairly quickly learn to use any other javascript library.
